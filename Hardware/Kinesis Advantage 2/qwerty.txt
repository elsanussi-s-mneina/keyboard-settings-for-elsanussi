* This makes using a Dvorak keyboard layout while on the hardware QWERTY setting, 
* match like the Kinesis Dvorak was designed to be.

* In more detail:
* The following make the Hardware QWERTY layout equivalent to the Hardware DVORAK layer.
* I do these changes because I set the keyboard layout on my operating system to Dvorak rather than on the Kinesis Advantage 2. The reason for this is that way I do not have to switch to Dvorak every time I type in Arabic. For those who don't know, the Arabic PC keyboard layout has no relation to Dvorak and Qwerty, so using a hardware Dvorak setting would simply scramble the keys for no good reason and make it too difficult to type.

* I need the alt key closer because I use it often to type international characters.
* For some reason The original position is uncomfortable for my hand.
