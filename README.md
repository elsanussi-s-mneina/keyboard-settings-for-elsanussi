# keyboard-settings-for-elsanussi

These are settings for Computer keyboards used by Elsanussi Mneina that are customized in some way.

## What are some common modifications you do to your keyboard layouts.
I currently use Dvorak which is a less common layout than QWERTY. Due to that,
and due to the fact that I type languages other than English that use the Latin alphabet, I
often find that there is no good Dvorak layout for typing those languages. At one point,
I attempted to make a Dvorak extended keyboard layout which would support very many languages
that use the Latin character set, but I found that the amount of keypresses it required for
typing characters such as Ã© (e with acute accent) and so on was simply too much for anything but occasional use.

Finally I noticed that most people don't know how to use the alt key, or alt-Gr key on Windows.
And also although many keyboards use Caps Lock for providing access to characters other than capital letters, the regular
user is generally clueless about this feature.

So, some of my more recent custom keyboard layouts do not make use of Caps-lock and the alt-key to access extra characters.
Instead I rely on dead-keys that are on the keyboard.

Some people may argue that the Caps Lock is necessary for programming for writing identifiers for constants such as SOME_NUMBER,
but it is not an issue for me because I use Sticky Keys.

With Sticky Keys, I can simply tap the shift key twice and Shift is locked. Then I can type all those capital letters, including the underscore.
Then I press the Shift key again to turn Shift lock off.
